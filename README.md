│   │  └── shared — React components that are being used across the whole website
│   ├── hooks
│   ├── images — Images that are being quired using graphql. Read more about it here — gatsbyjs.org/docs/working-with-images. Also note, that folder structure should be equal to the structure of components folder
│   ├── pages
│   ├── styles

├── gatsby-browser.js — This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. Read more about it here — gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis
├── gatsby-config.js — This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. Read more about it here — gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config
├── gatsby-node.js — This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. Read more about it here — gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis
└── gatsby-ssr.js — This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. Read more about it here — gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis

## Component Folder Structure

### Each component includes

1. Main JavaScript File
2. Index File

### Each component optionally may include

1. Folder with icons and images

Also, each component may include another component that follows all above listed rules.

### Example structure

```bash
component
├── nested-component
│  ├── images
│  │  ├── image.png
│  │  └── icon.svg
│  ├── nested-component.js
│  └── index.js
├── images
│  ├── image.png
│  └── icon.svg
├── component.js
└── index.js
```

## Code Style

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) helps find and fix code style issues and force developers to follow same rules. Current configuration is based on [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Additional commands:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run it to check the current status of eslint issues across project.

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

Run it to fix all possible issues.

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) helps to format code based on defined rules. [Difference between Prettier and ESLint](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html).

Additional commands:

```bash
npm run format
```

Run it to format all files across the project.

### VS Code

Following extensions required to simplify the process of keeping the same code style across the project:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

After installation enable "ESLint on save" by adding to your VS Code settings.json the following line:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
}
```

You can navigate to settings.json by using Command Pallete (CMD+Shift+P) and then type "Open settings.json".

To enable Prettier go to Preferences -> Settings -> type "Format". Then check that you have esbenp.prettier-vscode as default formatter, and also enable "Format On Save".

Reload VS Code and auto-format will work for you.
